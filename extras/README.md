# Advent of Code 2019 Extras
This space highlight some of the more creative solutions I designed on top of the straight forward solutions in the [main section](../README.md), including additional information and showcases.

## Day 8 - Animation using Python and Gimp

Part 2 of day 8 required mashing together a bunch of layers to get to the final solution. While this can be done in code alone, I decided to solve the puzzle with an animated GIF. My [python script](../2019_08_animation.py) creates a transparent image for each layer and saves it to the disk (in ./images/, which has to be created manually in advance, if you want to try it yourself).

Afterwards, all you have to do is import the result in Gimp, tinker with the background and the timing as you please, and save it as animated GIF.

Here is the result for my input:
